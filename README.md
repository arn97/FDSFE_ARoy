Hello,
This is Arnab Roy, and I am enrolled in the PhD in Applied Mathematics + Masters in Data Science program. I am taking this course as a part of the MSDS degree. However most of my research revolves around machine learning with some time series data. So I am very hopeful that this course will provide me with some tools that will be directly useful for my research. About my strengths, I can't make any comments yet as I don't really know enough about this course to identify characteristics relevant to this course.
